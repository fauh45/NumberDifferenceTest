Slight notice on the **project structure**, the project structure is changed to follow [Maven Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html#introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout), without any changes to the inherent code itself.
